## About

This folder contains my solutions to assignments for Scripting Languages course. Each of the assignments needs more the one solution (for example in `bash` and `tcsh`). I will do my best and try to follow the best practices while writing those scripts, but don't take my word for it...

IMPORTANT: Before you consider writing your script in c shell - if reading my scripts in tcsh wasn't enough you might want to take a look at those:
- [CSH PROGRAMMING CONSIDERED HARMFUL](http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/shell/csh-whynot/)
- [Top Ten Reasons not to use the C shell](http://www.grymoire.com/unix/CshTop10.txt)

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Print current user [`bash`](whoami.bash) [`tcsh`](whoami.tcsh)
- [x] 2a. Multiplication table [`bash`](multiplication-table.bash) [`tcsh`](multiplication-table.tcsh)
- [x] 2b. Multiplication table with given range [`bash`](multiplication-table-in-range.bash) [`tcsh`](multiplication-table-in-range.tcsh)
- [x] 2c. Any calculation table with given range [`bash`](calculation-table-in-range.bash) [`tcsh`](calculation-table-in-range.tcsh)
- [ ] 3. Ping IP's in range `bash` `tcsh`
- [ ] 4. Describe active IP `bash` `tcsh`

## Usage

#### bash / tcsh

Make sure the one of these shells is installed and shebang included in the script file matches your shell location on your system, then from command line run:

```
$ ./script.sh
```
