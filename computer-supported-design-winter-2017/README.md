# Computer Supported Design (Winter 2017)

## Assignments

I will be working on one project which is the [ShapeGrammar](ShapeGrammar/) iOS app project.

- [x] 1. Shape grammar

	Create a simple shape using the defined grammar

- [x] 2. Preference function

	Implement a function that will generate a random shape using your grammar. Next add function that will evaluate generated shape and give it a score depending on preferences.

- [x] 3. Evolutionary algorithm

	An algorithm that will generate a number of sample shapes, and with the help of preference function will pick only those with the highest score then apply these shapes to the main grammar
