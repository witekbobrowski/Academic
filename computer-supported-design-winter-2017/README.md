# Computer Supported Design (Winter 2017)

## About

A rather silly class, so don't expect a lot of educational value...

## Assignments

To do these I will be working on one project which is the [ShapeGrammar](ShapeGrammar/) iOS app project.

- [x] 1. Shape grammar

	Create a simple shape using the defined grammar

- [x] 2. Random generator and grading function

	Implement a function that will generate a random shape using your grammar. Next add function that will evaluate generated shape and give it a score depending on preferences.
