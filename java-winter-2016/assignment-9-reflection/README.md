## Reflection

Here I'm using reflection to print methods, fields, classes, interfaces, constructors of any given class. The Creator.class creates object of chosen class and then calls on it a method that takes one argument of choice. Test.class is here to demonstrate Creator functionality.

## What's included

```
reflection/
├── Creator.java
├── Signature.java
└── Test.java
```

## Usage

Compile and run

```
javac reflection/*.java
java reflection.Signature
```
